/**
\mainpage Charon Template Generator

\section overview Overview

This application may be used to set up code template
files to generate charon modules.
These files contain all code required to compile
the modules and to register their parameters and slots.
The algorithm code that has to be executed by the module
has to be inserted into the execute function
located in the ModuleName.hxx (for templated modules)
or the ModuleName.cpp (for untemplated modules) file,
a comment string shows you where.

\section validation Input Validation
