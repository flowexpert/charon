		<title>About the manpages</title>
		<para>
			The manpages show how to call the applications shipped with
			<ulink url="http://charon-suite.sourceforge.net">charon-suite</ulink>
			from the command line and give a reference of their command line
			options and parameters.
		</para>
		<para>
			The manpages are generated from the
			<ulink url="http://www.docbook.org">docbook</ulink> xml files located
			in the <filename class="directory">man</filename> directory of the
			projects.
			If you are using linux binary packages (e.g. deb packages),
			it is likely that these manpages already have been installed to your
			system.
			E.g. typing
			<code><command>man</command> <replaceable>charon</replaceable></code>
			at the command prompt should show the page
			<xref linkend="man-charon"/>.
		</para>
		<para>
			The html pages you are currently reading are another possibility to
			read the man page content online.
			The pages are synchronized with the current <command>bzr</command>
			upstream located at
			<ulink url="http://code.launchpad.net/~charon-developers">
				launchpad</ulink>.
