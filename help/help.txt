<h1>Tuchulcha help</h1>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
The best way to get started is reading ParamEdit introduction.
This can be done by selecting introduction from the help menu.
</p>

<h2>Window elements</h2>
<p>
Here you find some information about the elements in the program window.
</p>

<h3>Flowchart window</h3>
<p>
On application start, there is no flowchart window avaiable.
You can open an arbitrary numer of flowchart windows via opening
existing documents or creating new ones. Both can be found in the
file menu. (new document: Ctrl+N, open existing document: Ctrl+O)
</p>
<p>
The flow window shows the flowchart representation of the object
structures found in the associated parameterfile document.
This structure can be edited by drag&drop (see introduction).
The parameterfile content can be saved and reloaded.
</p>

<h3>Object inspector</h3>
<p>
The object inspector shows parameters for the currently selected
object (select objects in the flowchart window).
Unset parameters are shown in gray, their value is the default value
found in the class description file.
The parameter values can be changed by pressing F2 or by double click
on the value you want to change. Changing an unset value will change
its status to "set". To reset parameters to their default value, select
"reset selected parameters" from the edit menu.
</p>
<p>
To get a short documentation for a parameter, point at it with the
mouse. A tooltip containing this documentation will appear.
</p>

<h3>Selector widget</h3>
<p>
The selector widget provides template instances of all avaiable classes.
You can instanciate them by double click or by dragging them onto the
flowchart window. (Double click will add a new instance to the currently
active flowchart).
</p>
<p>
You can filter the shown templates by selecting
"only show connectable items" which hides classes with no slots matching
to the currently selected flowchart node. Editing the search field
will show only classes containing the given text in their class name.
</p>
<p>
The "show all" button resets the search text to an empty text and
disables the search for connectable slots. All avaiable classes will
be shown. This can be changed again modifing search or the connection
filter.
</p>
<p>
Clicking on a class in the selector widget will show the corresponding
class documentation in the help browser.
</p>

<h3>Help browser</h3>
<p>
The help browser serves to show help documents and class documentation.
The help browser content can be changed selecting "Help" or
"Introduction" from the help menu (or the corresponding shortcuts or
toolbar buttons) or by clicking on a class in the selector widget
(this only works if there is an active parameterfile document).
