<h1>Welcome to Tuchulcha</h1>
<p>
You can always open this document selecting "Introduction" in the Help menu.
</p>

<h2>Start</h2>
<p>
To create a new (empty) file, select file-&gt;new or use the shortcut <code>CTRL+N</code>.<br />
To open an existing file, select file-&gt;open or use <code>CTRL+O</code>.
</p>
<h2>Editing a Document</h2>
<p>
If you have an open document, you can add new items by drag&amp;drop (choose one from the selector widget and drag it onto the document) or by double click on the item to add. You will be asked for a valid object name. Per default, an object name that does not conflict with any existing object will be proposed. In most situations, there is no need to change this name.
</p><p>
If you click at an item in the selector widget, the corresponding class documentation will appear here in the help browser.
</p><p>
Connections between objects can also be established by drag&amp;drop, simply drag the source slot onto the target slot. If an input slot is already connected, it will be disconnected before establishing the new connection. If an input slot may be connected to multiple targets, new connections will be added instead of replacing the existing one(s).
</p><p>
To disconnect slots, use the disconnect button from the tool bar (disconnects all input and output slots of the selected module) or for more control, use the context menu which offers options to disconnect individual slots.
</p><p>
Objects can be deleted pressing the <code>DEL</code> key and renamed using <code>F2</code>. In either case, a dialog will ask for your confirmation. These options are also available in the context menu.
</p><p>
Object parameters can be changed using the objectIspector widget. Tooltips show a short documentation for each parameter.
