\section intro Overview
Charon-utils is a collection of routines and classes used in the charon
project and tuchulcha. There are many basic image manipulation routines
and a framework of serializable objects which can collaborate in a signal/slot
style. A sample collection of serializable classes is able to perform basic
image manipulation and display the result.

\section libs Used libraries
Charon-utils does only depend on the CImg image library which consist only
on one single header file and runs on multiple platforms. On unix system,
the libraries are linked against X11 et al, in Windows systems, no additional
libraries are needed.

-   %Convolution framework (see namespace Convolution)
